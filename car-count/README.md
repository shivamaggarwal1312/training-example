# Car Count Application

### About
This is a spring boot application which is exposing a REST endpoint(/car/count) to get the count of cars on a road equipped with sensor.


### Technology for sensors 
Different types of sensors that can be used:
* Pneumatic tube vehicle counting technique
* Piezoelectric Sensor
* Inductive Loop
 
### Others
* Maven
* JAVA 8
* Spring Boot

### Explanation
* In pneumatic tube counting we put a rubber pipe across the road which is connected to a data logger.The other end of the pipe is sealed. When a vehicle hits the pipe, air pressure activates the data logger.

*Piezoelectric sensors collect data by converting mechanical energy into electrical energy. The piezoelectric sensor is mounted in a cut into road surface.
